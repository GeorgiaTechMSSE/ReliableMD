Verified Solvers for sparse linear (interval) systems
===================================================

The SparseLinSys package contains the following verified solvers:

1.A solver (slss) based on the modified Krawczyk operator with 3 methods to solve the
  occurring triangular systems with interval right hand side: simple forward/backward
  substitution (only applicable for matrices with special structure, especially M-matrices),
  inversion of the triangular matrices (very costly in most cases) and forward/backward 
  substitution using parallel epipeds (works well for very small bandwidth b<10).
 
2.A solver (slssn) based on a normwise error estimation. For point systems and interval
  systems with small width this solver works best in general, especially for symmetric
  positive definite systems. However, for general system with condition >10^8 it will 
  often fail.

Solver 1 gives better enclosures for interval systems, but is somewhat slower and 
applicable to a smaller class of systems. Solver 2 will be faster in general and gives
good enclosures for point systems and interval systems with small width. Both can profit
a lot from multithreading, especially for larger systems. OpenMP should be activated
if available.
 


Quick installation instructions:

Requirements:
-C-XSC version 2.5.4 or higher
-SuiteSparse, version 4.0.2 or higher (tested with version 4.0.2) using Metis 4.0
-C++ Compiler with OpenMP capabilities recommended
-Optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries recommended (also for the installation of SuiteSparse)


Installation:
-Rename the file Makefile.generic to Makefile 
-Edit the file according to your needs by following the explanations
 in the file
-Type "make lib" to compile the solver library, or just
 "make" to compile the library and the examples
-After compilation the library will reside in the lib
 directory, the needed header files in the include directory
 and the compiled example program in the bin directory

Take a look at the example files and the header sparselinsys.hpp in the include directory
for usage details.
