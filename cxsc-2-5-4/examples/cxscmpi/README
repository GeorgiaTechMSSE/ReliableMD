MPI Interface for C-XSC data types
Version: 27.09.2011

Purpose:
When writing MPI programs using C-XSC, this interface allows
to use C-XSC data types (like interval, imatrix, cvector etc.)
with the standard MPI communication routines.

Files:
cxsc_mpicomm.hpp      Header file for MPI communication routines
cxsc_mpicomm.cpp      Implementation of routines
cxsc_mpi_example.cpp  Example program
Makefile              Makefile to compile the example

Usage:
Include the Header cxsc_mpicomm.hpp in your program. When compiling,
also compile and link to cxsc_mpicomm.cpp and the mpi library. The 
usage of the communication functions is the same as for standard data 
types. The file cxsc_mpi_example.cpp contains a simple example.


ATTENTION:
==========

Contrary to older versions, you need to initialize the communication buffer by calling

init_CXSC_MPI(); //initializes buffer of default size

or 

init_CXSC_MPI(int n); //initializes buffer with n bytes

before the first MPI communication function using a C-XSC data type is called. 
The needed buffer size depends on the maximum amount of raw data you want to 
send. In many cases the default size should be sufficient. However, if you get
an MPI truncation error during execution of your programm the buffer size is 
most likely to small and should be increased.

When you do not need to use MPI communication functions for C-XSC data type 
anymore, you should call 

finish_CXSC_MPI();

to free the memory for the communication buffer.
