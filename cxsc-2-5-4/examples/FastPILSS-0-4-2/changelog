Version 0.4.2
=============

-Added matrix mode for K=1, improving speed for multiple right hand sides and result quality. See documentation.
-Several bug fixes concerning data distribution and non-square systems.
-Increased buffer length for MPI communications. Old setting could lead to MPI communication errors in some situations.


Version 0.4.1
=============

-ATTENTION! The interface has again been slightly modified. Please consult the documentation and example programs.
-Some bugs in the computation of the inner enclosures have been corrected.
-Optional iterative refinement step added.
-Some further configuration options have been added.


Version 0.4
=============

-ATTENTION! New interface: Solvers use a struct for configuration options. See example programs and documentation.
-Solvers can now also compute inner enclosures.
-Fixed some bugs with the Intel compiler and Intel MPI.


Version 0.3.1
=============

-Fixed some bugs in the C-XSC MPI Interface that could lead to MPI truncation errros and adapted the solver accordingly.


Version 0.3
=============

-Serial solvers have been moved directly into C-XSC and are now longer a part of this package.
-Solvers have been adapted to use new features of C-XSC 2.4.0 (this is now the minimum required version).
-Now uses new C-XSC MPI Interface for C-XSC 2.4.0.
-Some minor bug fixes.


Version 0.2.1
=============

-Added configuration flag to file lss.inc to set naming conventions when calling a Fortran function from C/C++.
-Added configuration flag to file lss.inc to set tool to create static libraries.
-Fixed a bug in the data distribution for stage two of the solver.
-Changed parallel examples to make usage more clear.
-Improved compatibility with HP compiler.
-Some minor bug fixes and improvements.


Version 0.2
===========

-Fixed a bug in the C-XSC MPI package when using the Intel C++ Compiler.
-Enhanced compatibility with C-XSC 2.2.3.
-Right hand side and solution are now matrices (support for multiple right hand sides).
-Solvers are now compiled into libraries for easier use in user programs.
-Serial solvers now support OpenMP.
-Solvers are now implemented as templates (same source for all datatypes).
-Some small bug fixes and performance improvements.
