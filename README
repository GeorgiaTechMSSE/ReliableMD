There are 4 different sources of R-MD that comes along with the paper: 

Tran, Anh V., and Yan Wang. "Reliable Molecular Dynamics: Uncertainty quantification using interval analysis in molecular dynamics simulation." 
Computational Materials Science 127 (2017): 141-160.

To compile the source from a specific source folder, use 

make openmpi

While other options are available, they have not been tested under the development process.
